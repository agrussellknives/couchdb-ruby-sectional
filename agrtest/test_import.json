They used the most talented and skillful workers in the entire area for each step.  The finest hand forgers, the finest grinders, polishers, heat-treaters and in their own shop they employed the most skilled cutlers and hafters in the World.  Right up until the company was destroyed by the bankruptcy court in the Summer of 1980, the quality remained the finest in the entire World of knives.  I bought the company in early 1975 when it was one day from bankruptcy and changed the name from C. Bertram Reinh. Sohn to Bertram GMBH, moved all 14 employees from 20 hours a week to 40 hours and kept them working until I was overwhelmed by a severe bout of depression 1979-1984.  Between 1975 and 1980, the cost of labor more than doubled as the dollar fell against the DMark.  The one thing we managed to hold on to was the supreme quality.  Today there are makers in this country, like Tony Bose, his son and a handful of others who have taught themselves to make traditional pocketknives of this quality.</p>    <p>I have nurtured our inventory of \"\"original\"\" Hen & Rooster knives, selling only a few each year for the past 24 years.  Our inventory has gradually diminished, and there are only a handful of most models left.  This is a rare opportunity, because the quantity of these two models is extremely low.  When we have sold all of the regular inventory, I will offer for sale the salesman's sample knives from the late 1800s and early 1900s.</p>    <p>When you think of these knives you have to think of quality that matches makers like Tony Bose, or if you like, traditional pocketknives in quality like the knives of William Henry.  These knives are the finest and rarest you can buy.  The skilled workmen who made them are dead or long retired.  We will indicate how many we have in stock.

Germany was in a recession and the firm was on the verge of bankruptcy.  First I had to buy the entire inventory for cash, including the old salesman's samples, some over 100 years of age.  I later learned that this was Edgar's way of taking money from the other grandson of the founder, his partner.  Over the next five years, we made some of the finest traditional pocket knives the world has ever seen.  The last knives made in the original way, by the original firm were made in 1980, 26 years ago.  These knives have set in our warehouse all of that time, being sold a few a year.  Only makers like Tony Bose and a tiny handful of other makers can make knives of this quality.  When these are gone they will be gone forever.</p>    <p>The Hen & Rooster mark is presently owned by Jim Frost of Frost Cutlery in TN.  In the 1980s, he had Hen & Rooster knives made by the Kissing Krane company in Solingen.  Since Kissing Krane disappeared Boker has made the knives.
